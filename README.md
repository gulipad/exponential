**Best with:** Product strategy • TypeScript / React • Supabase (Edge Functions, Postgres) • Early-stage company building • Notion/Loom & async comms  
**Familiar with:** Ruby on Rails • Streamlit • Blockchain tooling • AI/LLM integrations (Gemini, GPT) • Chrome/Browser extensions

> 💡 **TL;DR** – I’m a Spanish product-builder & repeat founder who loves shipping useful (sometimes downright fun) software.  
> Co-founded fintech **Capchase** (> $1 B deployed) and the non-profit **Exponential Fellowship** (helping top young Spaniards join US startups). In my spare time I hack on OSS tools, bots, and date-pickers, invest in promising founders, and write detailed handbooks so teams know exactly how I work.

## About Guli

Madrid-based “builder at heart.” Formally an Aerospace engineer, I gravitated to software because it lets you invent at the speed of thought. Today I split time between leading Product at **Capchase**, mentoring Exponential Fellows in SF & NYC, and tinkering on side-projects that scratch my curiosity itch. You can read more about me [here](https://www.gulipad.com/).

### My vision

Over the next 5 years I’ll keep scaling Capchase, grow the Fellowship to 100+ alumni, and back ≥ 20 technical Spanish founders as an angel. Building in the US ecosystem lets me compound learning, capital, and network—fuel I’ll ultimately redirect toward Spain’s tech renaissance.
